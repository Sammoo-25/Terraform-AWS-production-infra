# Terraform-AWS-Architecture

Welcome to the Terraform-AWS-Architecture project! This repository demonstrates the implementation of scalable and resilient architectures on AWS using Terraform. The infrastructure is defined as code, allowing for easy deployment, management, and version control.

## Project Overview

This project aims to showcase the following AWS architectures:

- 2-Tier Architecture: A two-tier architecture with a web tier and database tier. It includes EC2 instances, load balancers, and RDS instances.

- 3-Tier Architecture: A three-tier architecture with a web tier, application tier, and database tier. It includes EC2 instances, auto scaling groups, load balancers, and RDS instances.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `/2-Tier-Architecture`: Contains the Terraform code for the 2-tier architecture.

- `/3-Tier-Architecture`: Contains the Terraform code for the 3-tier architecture.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- Terraform installed on your local machine.
